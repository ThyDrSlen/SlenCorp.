<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a web page can be easier than you think many people think of building a web page as a process that takes years and a big team. In reality making a web page can be easier than baking a cake. All that is needed is a computer,general computer knowledge, a program that allows for text manipulation ex. Google Docs, Text Edit. You can also use specialized coding programs such as &nbsp;Sublime Text,Atom.io. Creating a website is not a time consuming hobby and can actually be a fun way to express yourself. Patience is needed when creating a html website because computers,web pages, and browsers read code.HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step to creating an HTML Page is knowing where to start. You need a program that allows for html files such as Text Edit or Sublime Text. Sublime Text is the prefered program because it allows you to see where you code may have correct syntax.Sublime Text 3 may be downloaded from the </span><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3"><strong>Sublime Text 3</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> page. This is the recommended version of Sublime Text to use, and is available for Windows, OS X and Linux. Once downloaded you can install it by clicking on the file in the downloads folder. When you have set up the program set the file extension to html by clicking on &ldquo;Plain Text&rdquo; then scrolling down and finding the HTML.Refer to the image to the on the right to the location of Plain Text.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second major step is actually creating the code.In sublime text just type &lt;ht then hit enter.This will automatcailty create a html template.If you were to not have sublime text you need to first write &lt;html&gt; this is the most basic tag in HTML and is what accualty identifies the code as HTML instead of just another piece of text.Most tags like &lt;html&gt; needed to be ended but there are a few expections.The &lt;html&gt; tag is ended by typing &lt;/html&gt; the foward slash is what identfies it as a closing tag. Tags needed to be closed to give instructions to the code where to do certain things.In this instance the closing tag for &lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt; defines where the html document ends.Then write the tag &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;. This tag is used as a container for head elements such as the &lt;title&gt; tag this tag gives a title to the webpage that is displayed on the site&rsquo;s tab. The other head element is the &nbsp;&lt;style&gt; tag which can customize attributes of the code such as color,size,font,etc. The last step in setting up a web page is adding the &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tags.This tag signifies the content of the web page in here you will put any information that you want displayed for someone viewing the webpage.Such as paragraphs,lists,headings,images and tables.A correct html webpage&rsquo;s code looks like the image on the left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There you have it how to correct setup a HTML page all you need to do now is put in content that pertains to the objective or goal of your HTML webpage.You may want to learn how to structure and format your content using HTML tags.Which will be covered in the next essay.</span></p>
